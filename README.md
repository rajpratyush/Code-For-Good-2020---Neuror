Neuror is an app which provides autistic individuals an opportunity to find jobs that match their specific needs.

From our research and discussions we found that one of the most difficult thing for autistic people, when it comes to requirements, is whether the job matches them.

Initially we sent our scope to be broad covering a lot of issues however, of course, with our limited time set we decided to tackle one of the bigger issues and provide a framework which can be used to tackle a lot of further issues down the line

Provide a clean interface for users to sign up and register on platform.
Give users the ability to easily define areas where they would need additional support. 
-- Examples of this include:
*More rest time in interviews
*Maximum amount of people you will interface with in a day
*Times between rests
*Any support counselors provided, etc
*Provide a dashboard of jobs which is updated regularly
*Within the dashboard provide percentage matches of job to user based on criteria and descriptions
*Allow firms to add jobs to the dashboard and define the support that they can provide.

We also planned to incorporate AI algorithms such as NLP which scans the resume of each user and provide the companies with a list of prospect candidates and another NLP which scans the the job postings and provides the user job posting for which he/she is most suitable for.
But since we didn't had any of the actual data, our planning was limited to mere plans rather than putting the plan into the action.  

From this, when users apply to jobs the firms will be notified completely about the users needs which means that transparency is met.
